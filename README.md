# CoconutMC

CUSTOM MODPACK ! 92 mods inside for all conveinance 

How to install ? 
Download the .zip from here, extract it. 

When i extract it i see another .zip file inside (CoconutMC-1.00.zip) , is that normal?
- YES ! , DONT extract this one ! (that's the modpack)

Once that done you will open forge ( like here : https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.16.5.html )
1) Create custom profile

2)import

3) take coconutMC-1.00.zip and that's it!
